### TITANIC CLASSIFICATION 

Make a system which tells whether the person will be saved from sinking. What factors were most likely to lead to success: socioeconomic status, age, gender and more.

The 'FamilySize' feature is used as it can potentially capture additional information about a passenger's likelihood of survival. Here's why it might be useful:
</br>
Rescue Priority: During the Titanic disaster, women and children were given priority for lifeboats. Having a larger family size (e.g., parents with children) might indicate a higher priority for rescue, thus potentially increasing the chances of survival.
Support System: Having family members onboard could provide emotional support and assistance, which might increase the likelihood of survival in a stressful situation.
Shared Tickets: In some cases, family members might share the same ticket or fare, which could indicate a closer relationship and potentially affect survival chances.
Group Behavior: Family groups might behave differently in emergencies compared to individual passengers, which could impact survival outcomes.
